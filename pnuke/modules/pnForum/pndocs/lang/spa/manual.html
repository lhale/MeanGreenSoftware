  1.2 Using PostNuke permissions with the phpBB_14 bulletin board.<br>

  This chapter assumes that you already know Rogue permissions principles. <br>

  phpBB_14 implements four levels/instances of controlling access rights to the 

  module. <br>

  These are: <br>

  Category <br>

  Forum <br>

  StatsBlock <br>

  You are therefore able to control how a user or a user group may use your forum. 

  <br>

  Note: Earlier versions of phpBB_14 had the option of setting a forumtype to 

  be 'private|public'. This option is not used any more. Only Rogue permissions 

  will be checked when accessed. </p>

<p>This is also correct regarding moderator access to forums and categories. Moderator 

  access is checked against MODERATE_ACCESS in PostNuke permission system for 

  any given user or group. Setting the moderator parameter inside phpBB_14 administration 

  panel, is not currently in use. The parameter will be deprecated in future versions. 

</p>

<p>Following are some examples on how to use the PostNuke 0.71x permission system 

  in the phpBB_14 module. We will use these names in the examples to give you 

  a &quot;realworld&quot; examples: <br>

  Category: General <br>

  Forum: Chitchat and discussion <br>

  Usergroup: Mygroup <br>

  User: JimDude </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 1. <br>

  Cut off Unregistered users from accessing private forum. Unregistered users 

  will not even see that a private forum exists. <br>

  Go to Administration/Permissions/New group permission </p>

<p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered phpBB_14::Forum Chitchat:: None </p>

<p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 

  be above this line: <br>

  Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered .* .* Read </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 2. <br>

  Cut off Unregistered users to a whole category. All forums inside the category 

  will be inaccessible. </p>

<p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered phpBB_14::Category General:: None </p>

<p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 

  be above this line: <br>

  Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered .* .* Read </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 3. <br>

  Let Unregistered users view forums in a category, but not post or reply to posts. 

  <br>

  (as the smart eye sees, dropping the following line, will cause unregistered 

  users to have read-access to all categories) </p>

<p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered phpBB_14::Category General:: Read </p>

<p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 

  be above this line: <br>

  Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Unregistered .* .* Read </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 4. <br>

  Let a closed Usergroup access all forums in a category. All users not in this 

  group fully cut off. </p>

<p>The first thing to do is to create the Usergroup and populate it with users 

  (we will not show how to do this here). </p>

<p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Mygroup phpBB_14::Category General:: Edit <br>

  All groups phpBB_14::Category General:: None </p>

<p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permissions should 

  be above BOTH of these lines: <br>

  Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  Users .* .* Comment <br>

  Unregistered .* .* Read </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 5. <br>

  Assign moderator rights to a specific user. This is done in two parts. <br>

  First you have to define the user as a moderator of the forum, using the phpBB_14 

  admin pane. (Note, this is only for viewing purposes in the forums at this time...)<br>

  Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke <br>

  permission system. This is done using this scheme: </p>

<p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  JimDude phpBB_14::Forum Chitchat:: Moderate </p>

<p>NB! Be very careful of using USER permissions. They will always override any 

  group permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting your self 

  out! Always use other usernames that your ADMIN name, when playing around with 

  user permissions!! </p>

<p><br>

  EXAMPLE 6. <br>

  Assign a user to be moderator for two forums. <br>

  This is done in two parts. First you assign the user as moderator to both the 

  forums, using the phpBB_14 admin pane. <br>

  Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke permission 

  system. This is done using this scheme: </p>

<p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>

  JimDude phpBB_14::Forum (ChitChat|discussion):: Moderate </p>

<p>Note: <br>

  Be very careful when using USER permissions. They will always override any group 

  permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting your self out! 

  Always use other usernames than your ADMIN name, when playing around with user 

  permissions!!</p>

<p>We also suggest looking at the PostNuke permissions documentation:<br>

  <a href="http://centre.ics.uci.edu/~grape/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Wiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=PERMISSIONS" target="_blank">http://centre.ics.uci.edu/~grape/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Wiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=PERMISSIONS</a></p>

  1.3 Setting up Statistics block </p>

<p>You can activate and place this block, using standard Rogue Blocks administrating. 

  <br>

  Create a new block of type 'phpBB_14/phpBB_14 Statistics'. Configure it to with 

  the PostNuke 'Edit' feature to meet your needs.<br>

  Also see 2.3.5</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

  1.4 Setting up Search Include</p>

<p>The search routine for phpBB_14 is included in the module core and needs no 

  special set-up to be used with PostNuke.<br>
