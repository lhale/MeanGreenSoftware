  Introduction</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Thank
  		 you for choosing pnForum as your PostNuke forum software. pnForum is
  		based
    on the phpBB-forum originally created by '<a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">The
     phpBB Group</a>'. We have added an extensive list of features to pnForum
      that I am sure you will enjoy. pnForum is designed for use as a module
     with
    the PostNuke, .75x (<a href="http://postnuke.com" target="_blank">http://postnuke.com</a>)</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We
  		 have spent a lot of time on this product and hope that you find it to
  		be	as
    useful as we intended it to be. Support for pnForum can be found at </span><a href="http://pncommunity.de/index.htm" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a>
    with a multilingual FAQ area both for Users and Admins and at <a href="http://snowbankih.tzo.com" target="_blank">http://snowbankih.tzo.com</a>

  <p class="MsoPlainText">After you have installed pnForum, we encourage you
  	 to list your web site in the 'Demo' forum on <a href="http://pncommunity.de/index.htm" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="installation"></a>2. Installation</p>
<p><a name="210"></a>2.1 Requirements</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>pnForum is designed to run as a module under the PostNuke .75x
  	 series. It is assumed that you have the appropriate version of PostNuke
  	already running on your web site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="220"></a>2.2 Install preparations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2.2.1. Please check if this is the latest version available at <a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a>
    or<a href="http://snowbankih.tzo.com" target="_blank"> http://snowbankih.tzo.com</a>
    first. These are the primary support sites for the pnForum module with a
     multilingual FAQ area both for Users and Admins.</p>
  <p>2.2.2. Make a backup of your PostNuke database (we recommend using phpMyAdmin)
    and the entire /html/modules/pnForum directory. Then, remove the following
    directories and files: <br>
    /modules/pnForum <br>
    /includes/search/pnForum.php <br>
    /includes/blocks/pnForum.php </p>
  <p>This will prevent you from creating potential errors if there were any changes
    in the filenames or an error in the setup. <br>
    This is a safe proceedure, since all these files will be restored from the
     new distribution and all forum settings are kept in the database.</p>
  <p>Right now we do do not have a script  designed specifically for backing
    up the pnForum-module related tables in your database. And since backup is
  	a good idea
    for all Phoenix
    tables, we suggest the

    use of phpMyAdmin. </p>
  <p>Important Notes: <br>
  1. Due to some changes in BBCode and Smilie-Handling
  within pnForum, it is advised that you install and activate three new modules;
  	pn_bbclick, pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile. These files are available in the 'Download'
  	areas
    at <a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a> and
  <a href="http://snowbankih.tzo.com">http://snowbankih.tzo.com</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="230"></a>2.3. Installation </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    2.3.1. Extract directories from distribution into the appropriate PostNuke
      Phoenix html directories.
    <br>
    No files from Phoenix or other modules can be damaged by doing this. <br>
    Do not rename the pnForum module directory. There are hard coded
     links to its name within this directory.<br>
    You can use any names in your forums when creating links in menublocks. </p>
  <p>2.3.2. Go to the PostNuke Administration panel,<br>
    enter the Modules section. Press the 'Regenerate' link. <br>
    You should see pnForum in the modules list. <br>
    Press 'Initialize' on the right side of the page. This will create the module's
    tables and fill in some constants. <br>
    Normally you should get a 'Module initialized' message at the top of the screen.
    <br>
    Press 'Activate' in pnForum line. <br>
    This will make pnForum Administration panel visible in PostNuke Administration.<br>
    Then,
    do the same 'Initialize' and 'Activate' procedures with the pn_bbcode, pn_bbclick
    and pn_bbsmile modules.<br>
    Now, while still in the Modules section,  the 'Regenerate' or 'List' links.
    To the far right side of the pnForum module listing, you will
    see
    'Deactivate
    | Edit'. Click on 'Edit'. Place a check mark in the three boxes to activate
    pn_bbcode, pn_bbclick and pn_bbsmile. Then save.</p>
  <p>2.3.3. Go to PostNuke Administration panel. <br>
    Select the pnForum link. <br>
    Click on 'Sync forum/topic index'. This will sync the list of users in PostNuke
    and pnForum.<br>
    Click on the 'Forum Wide Options' link .<br>
    Click on 'Restore defaults'. This will set parameters for pnForum </p>
  <p>2.3.4. Go to Administration/Blocks section. <br>
    In the appropriate menu block create a new entry for your forum. <br>
    For example 'Forums'. <br>
    Link should be: <br>
    {pnForum}<br>
    Save it. </p>
  <p>2.3.5. You're done with the pnForum module installation.<br>
    pnForum is now administered using the PostNuke Administration panel. <br>
    There you can make general forum settings, define new Categories, Forums,
    Private Forums, User Rights, User Ranks, Honorary Ranks, re-order categories
 and forums within them.</p>
  <p>2.3.6 If you have $bgcolor3 and $bgcolor4 as different colors in your theme,
    then you will get a color change with a 'mouse over' while in the forum index
    and category views. </p>
  <p>2.3.7 You can create background images for your tables. <br>
    cell1.gif for tableheader and cell2.gif for category (to be placed in /themes/YOUR_THEME/images)
    Both images must be liimited to 28 pixels in height.</p>
  <p>2.3.8 If you use style sheets in your themes, the styles contained in them
    will be reflected in pnForum. You can also use: pn-phpBB-Title, pn-phpBB-border
    and pn-phpBB-cat for additional customization of your forums.</p>
  <p>2.3.9 If you are using AutoTheme; $bgcolor1, $bgcolor2, $bgcolor3, and
  	$bgcolor4 are defined in /yourtheme/theme.cfg using the names 'color1', 'color2',
	'color3' and 'color4'.</p>

<p><a name="340"></a>3.4. Upgrading from phpBB_14 versions 1.7.2.1 - 1.7.2.x
(PostNuke .70x)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Due to changes in upgrade procedure between Phoenix releases .70x and .71x,
    there is no easy and fast way of doing this. <br>
    - write a note with the exact pnForum version that you had previously installed
    <br>
    - backup your database (see 'Note:' below)<br>
    - backup phpBB_14 tables <br>
    - drop the database tables and erase following folders:<br>
    modules/phpBB_14<br>
    includes/search/phpBB_14.php <br>
    includes/blocks/phpBB_14.php <br>
    - follow 2.3.1. (only this step)<br>
    - replace this line in pnversion.php <br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.4';<br>
    with <br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.0.0';<br>
    if your previous version were any from 1.7.0.0 to 1.7.0.3<br>
    <br>
    or with:<br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.0.4';<br>
    if your previous version were any from 1.7.0.4 to 1.7.2.0<br>
    - install module as a clean install.<br>
    - drop all pnForum tables<br>
    - restore your initial phpBB_14 tables from backup copy<br>
    - modify pnversion.php with version number you are installing<br>
    - follow 3.2.</p>

<p> <a name="420"></a>4.2 Using PostNuke permissions with the pnForum bulletin board:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p> This chapter assumes that you already know PostNuke permissions principles.
    <br>
    pnForum implements four levels/instances of controlling access rights to
    the module. <br>
    These are: <br>
    Category <br>
    Forum <br>
    Topic <br>
    StatsBlock <br>
    You are therefore able to control how a user or a user group may use your
    forum. <br>
 </p>
  <p>This is also correct regarding moderator access to forums and categories.
    Moderator access is checked against MODERATE_ACCESS in PostNuke permission
    system for any given user or group. Setting the moderator parameter inside
    pnForum administration panel is only for display purposes in forum and category
    view. The permissions are only defined by the permission system.</p>
  <p>Following are some examples on how to use the PostNuke 0.71x permission system
    in the pnForum module. We will use these names in the examples to give you
    a &quot;realworld&quot; examples: <br>
    Category: General <br>
    Forum: Chitchat and discussion <br>
    Usergroup: Mygroup <br>
    User: JimDude </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 1. <br>
    Cut off Unregistered users from accessing private forum. Unregistered users
    will not even see that a private forum exists. <br>
    Go to Administration/Permissions/New group permission </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered pnForum::Forum Chitchat:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 2. <br>
    Cut off Unregistered users to a whole category. All forums inside the category
    will be inaccessible. </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered pnForum::Category General:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 3. <br>
    Let Unregistered users view forums in a category, but not post or reply to
    posts. <br>
    (as the smart eye sees, dropping the following line, will cause unregistered
    users to have read-access to all categories) </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered pnForum::Category General:: Read </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 4. <br>
    Let a closed Usergroup access all forums in a category. All users not in this
    group fully cut off. </p>
  <p>The first thing to do is to create the Usergroup and populate it with users.
    (we will not show how to do this here..). </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Mygroup pnForum::Category General:: Edit <br>
    All groups pnForum::Category General:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permissions should
    be above BOTH of these lines: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Users .* .* Comment <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 5. <br>
    Assign moderator rights to a specific user. This is done in two parts. <br>
    First you have to define the user as a moderator of the forum, using the pnForum
    admin pane. (Note, this is only for viewing purposes in the forums at this
    time...)<br>
    Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke <br>
    permission system. This is done using this scheme: </p>
  <p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    JimDude pnForum::Forum Chitchat:: Moderate </p>
  <p>NB! Be very careful of using USER permissions. They will always override
    any group permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting
    your self out! Always use other usernames that your ADMIN name, when playing
    around with user permissions!! </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 6. <br>
    Assign a user to be moderator for two forums.<br>
    This is done in two parts. First you assign the user as moderator to both
    the forums, using the pnForum admin pane. <br>
    Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke <br>
    permission system. This is done using this scheme: </p>
  <p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    JimDude pnForum::Forum (ChitChat|discussion):: Moderate </p>
  <p>Note: <br>
    Be very careful when using USER permissions. They will always override any
    group permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting your
    self out! Always use other usernames than your ADMIN name, when playing around
    with user permissions!!</p>
