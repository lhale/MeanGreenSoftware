Mail2Forum
----------

Mail2forum allows you to mirror mailinglists into a forum. To do this, pnForum
connects to a pop3 server, usually invoked by cron, fetches mails and stores
them in the forum using a given user login.

If you use this, make sure that the mailing list does not send a monthly
password reminder! This will be mirrored to the forum as well!

Configuration
-------------

after saving.

posting user in the forum

Rule: not yet used

Usage:
------

Mails will be fetched using the mailcron.php script which usually gets called
by a cron job e.g. once per hour.

Before you can use this you have to do some changes to this file:

line 37: //
line 38: // store the absolut path to your PostNuke folder here
line 39: //
line 40: chdir('/opt/lampp/htdocs/760');

Change the chdir to point to the absolute path to your PostNuke installation
on your server.

There are no changes necessary beyond this point.

Manual usage:
-------------

http://www.example.com/modules/pnForum/mailcron.php?debug=1

connects to the mail server, fetches mails and stores them in the forums. The
?debug=1 shows what the script is doing.
