Previous maintainer's note:
Not much here yet, I hate writting non-code, it's not my strong point...
This is a module version of phpBB 1.4.1 for use with the PostNuke system.
A ton of code has been changed and more will be changed in the future.
There currently is no conversion script.  This is because I'm lazy, if
you would like to write one, Feel Free :-)
Thanks:
Without thee people, this module would be in even more of a mess then it
already is :-)
