******************
Important changes:
******************
- $loggedin in templates has been replaced with $pncore.logged_in. Customized templates
  need to be updated!
- finding the correct images for topics, new topics, hot topics and hot new topics (viewforum)
  is not longer done in program code but is now part of the template logic. There are two new fields in
  the topic array: new_posts and hot_topic, see the pnforum_user_viewforum.html template for more
  information. Custom templates might need some adjustments.
  The fields image, altimage and image_attr are obsolete now and have been removed!!
