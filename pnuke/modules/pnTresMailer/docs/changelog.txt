// Changelog
//
//
// 5.30 - removed email check for registered users in index.php
//		- for unsubscribed users names was wrong in list.
//			subscribers.php
//		- wrote new functions_mail.php to run better. It now saves an
//			archive of the text email also. This requires an upgrade.
//			edit also pninit.php, pntables.php
//		- since we are archiving the text mailers, we might as well make
//			them viewable. edit archives.php, functions.php
//			I decided not to make this an option for users
//		- added option to send all mailers out to each user one at a time
//			rather than in bulk. added global.php lang _READYTOSENDSINGLES,
//			_OUTOF, _EMAILSSENT, _CONTITOSENDHTML, _CONTITOSENDTEXT
//		- Daniel Luttermann updated deu lang files
//		- placed english definitions in other global lang files.
//
// 5.31 - pnlang/eng/subscribe_pop.php had bad link
//		- need strict php code for some versions of php. edit
//			email_test.php, email_validation.php, smtp.php.
//			thanks to dbrucas for locating this
//		- now you can update your plugins with one click. very exciting.
//			edit modules.php
//		- new feature for all plugins. set initial values with
//			modversion[mod_data]. This is really for future plugins so
//			the only change right now was to functions.php
//		- cron.php updated and tested thanks to ikke. cron must be run
//			through postnuke interface. this may cause errors on some
//			servers. use with caution.
//		- edit functions_mail.php to get rid of duplicate To: part of
//			email for alternate mailing method (hope no bugs from this)
//		- a ton of new plugins from Craig Ozancin included since they
//			work with core postnuke modules. they are: enhcommentssince,

//		- updated smtp.php, DNS.php, getmxrr.php
//		- added privacy statement to users page. index.php, global.php
//		- new SETTING to allow new subscribers to receive a copy of the
//			lastest newsletter when they signup. This required a database
//			change and means you have to upgrade the module. pninit.php,
//			pntables.php, vars.php, functions.php, global.php, index.php
//		- unregistered subscribers can now retrieve their username by
//			entering their email address. index.php, global.php
//		- new plugin - forward newsletter to a friend. this required that
//			the file forward.php be added to the root of the module dir.
//			also added the 2 usual plugin files fw_newsletter.php
//		- added a tracking system, but the catch is that you have to send
//			out the emails using the second option, sending individually.

//			tracker.php, functions.mail.php, pninit.php, pntables.php
//
// 5.34 - Display confirmation that new subscriber received copy of archived

//			mime types. changed function_mail.php, pntables.php, pninit.php
//			vars.php
//		- probably made a few other minor changes but I regretfully forgot
//			to update this changelog when I made them. I don't think any
//			other files have been altered.
//
// 5.70 - you must now generate the newsletter before sending it. This way
//			you can see it before it goes out. Also, you can generate
//			letters without having to email them. The main reason for doing
//			this is to speed up the send times for mailing. I think generating
//			the letter was making the email appear to take much longer.
//			also, nothing wrong with more control :). changed functions_mail.php,
//			eng language file
//		- remove the "*(r) indicates mailer read by subscriber" as it was
//			creating false readings that just makes things confusing. changed
//			subscribers.php
//		- added Loop Count to Settings. this is the number of emails to send
//			out before refreshing the page. changed vars.php, pninit.php,
//			pntables.php, functions.php, admin.php
//
// 5.71 - added user functions to the package. upload the contents of the NS-User
//			module folder and users will have a link in their account area to
//			access the pnTresMailer user page.
//
// 5.80 - added option to personalize individually sent emails with a subscribers
//			username. Turn it on in SETTINGS and add <!-- [USERNAME] -->
//			to have the system automatically insert the user's name.
//		- changed pninit.php, pntables.php, vars.php, functions.php,
//			functions_mail.php, archives.php and added to the end language file
//		- removed all upgrade support for versions prior to 5.34
//			you have to upgrade to that version before this version
//		- IMPORTANT!! changed the template inserts. what used to be inserted
//			with [ISSUE] is now <!-- [ISSUE] -->. This was done for those
//			using the peronalized options. this way these tags aren't
//			seen by the user if they don't get replaced.
//		- updated the install.txt file
//		- found and fixed an error in sending single email to one subscriber
//
// 5.81 - missing pntresmialer.gif graphic in NS-user module

//			text and html of the archive before mailing it out. edit
//			archives.php, functions.php, global.php eng lang file

//			click GENEREATE AND SEND. edit functions_mail.php
//
// 5.93 - turned tracker back on. edit functions_mail.php, subscribers.php
//			there is a settings at the top of subscribers.php (line 3)
//			that turns it on or off and will display a red (r) when
//			a subscribers opens the last newsletter sent. must be sent
//			individually or single and not bulk.
//		- to use the tracker, turn it on and add the tag: <!-- [TRACKER -->
//			Add the tag somewhre in the header, footer, or any other
//			part of the body of the newsletter.
//		- found error in functions_mail where sending single emails
//			was sending bad data.
//
// 5.94 - edited functions_mail.php. counting the emails wrong when
