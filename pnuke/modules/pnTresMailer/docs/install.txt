// Installation: pnTresMailer Newsletter Module v5.0+
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//
//  Included is mailer_import.php. Run this file, input the database
//	variables, and it will auto-import all of your registered users into
//	the subscription list for mailing. This is a simple way to get all of
//	your users into the mailing list in one step.
//
//
//  Also included is csv_import.php. This file will help you to import
//	unregistered users into your subscribers list. A brief explaination
//	on how to do this can be found further down this document.
//
//
//  Always, before making any additions or changes to your postnuke
//  installation, it is recommended that you back everything up.
//
//
//	If you are having trouble sending the newsletter out to all users, I
//	have added support for an ALTERNATE MAILING SYSTEM as defined in the
//	SETTINGS for the module. Sending your emails through the normal system
//	uses a direct connection to the smtp server and is the best way to go.
//	I included this alternate system for those that cannot use the smtp
//	setup. The alternate system uses the php mail() function and sends the
//	email to users through the Bcc header. This system IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR
//	WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.
//
//
// NEW INSTALL
//
// 1. upload the contents to the modules/pnTresMailer folder. deviation in
// 		the folder (module) name may cause errors.
// 
// 2. edit or create a new template for the html mailer. I have included
// 		the default mailer for my website as an example. It consists of
// 		a html.tpl for html emails and text.tpl for text emails. The images
//      in the same folder are those that belong in that template. You 
//      should also take note of the method for href links used.
//
//    option template inserts that will automatically be replaced with the
//		proper content are as follows:
//			<!-- ISSUE -->     = current issue number
//			<!-- DATE -->      = current issue date
//			<!-- HEADER -->    = header text placed edit in SETTINGS
//			<!-- NEWS -->      = module plugins data like the news
//			<!-- FOOTER -->    = footer text placed, edit in SETTINGS
//			<!-- USERNAME -->  = subscriber's username, must be turned on
//
//		note: the username insert tag can be placed in any portion of
//			the newsletter and is not restricted to the template
// 
// 3. initialize and activate as a module through postnuke administration.
//		The tables will be created for you.
//
//    If you're running pnTresMailer in an PostNuke >= 0.750 framework go to 
//    Administration->Settings and enable lagacy support.
// 
// 4. it will now show up in your administration panel.
// 
// 5. users subscription link: 
// 		http://yoursite.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=pnTresMailer&file=index
// 
// 6. You can also add the sideblock for subscriptions which is included
//

//
//
// csv_import.php : INSTRUCTIONS
//
// This file is described at the top of this document.
//
// It is always a good idea to backup your database before making changes.
//
// 1. Run this link: /modules.php?op=modload&name=pnTresMailer&file=csv_import&req=AddCsv
//
// 2. Open the CSV file that you created or exported from another program
//		and copy the contents into the text box.
//
//		A CSV file is a "Comma Separated Value" document. In this case, each
//		entry must be formatted as: Subscribers Name,Email@address.com
//		Here is a quick example:
//
//			Erik,erik@somedomain.com
//			Joe Johnson,jj@hisdomain.com
//			Alfred,Alphy@redsdomain.net
//			Humphrey,youknow@myaddress.com
//
// 3. Copy and paste the csv file contents into the text area.
//
// 4. Select the newsletter format to which these users will be subscribed.
//
// 5. Press the submit button below.
//
// 6. Each email address will be checked to make sure it doesn't already
//		exist in the database. Then it will be entered.
//
//
//
// MODULES FOR THE NEWSLETTER
//
// Modules (plugins) can be developed to suit your needs. I have included
//		basic modules for use with your Newsletter.
//
// What are Modules for pnTresMailer?
// - Modules are plugins to the module that allow you to add custom content
//		to the Newsletter simply.
//
// How do they work?
// - Basically, they are short scripts that grab and post the content from
//		your database or anywhere else you call to your newsletter. Once 
//		they are created and placed in the pnTresMailer/modules directory,
//		they are found by the system and made available for adding to
//		your Newsletter.
//
// Can I make my own?
// - If you can program php, then use any one of the supplied modules as
//		a guide to creating your new module. I left many of the notes and
//		comments in the supplied modules to help you with that. I would
//		also appreciate if you would send me a copy of the new module so
//		that I can add it the available downloads to other users of the
//		pnTresMailer module.
//
//
//
// FINAL NOTE
//
// Emails are being sent as BCC recipients. This means that you can
//		send more emails with less strain on the server.
//		The number of emails in the bcc column of the email is set
//		in the settings labelled -Max Emails in Bcc-. 500 is a good number
//		but counts as high as 1000 are not unheard of.
//
// Most servers can only handle about 100 emails before problems occur. By
//		placing the emails in groups of 500 (or whatever you set), you
//		lessen the strain on the server by cutting down on the emails sent.
//		You can send 500,000 emails now before worrying about problems
//		occuring... and since these emails are sent one at a time, even
//		500,000 is a low limit to consider.
