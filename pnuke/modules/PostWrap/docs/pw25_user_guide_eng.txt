Introduction
PostWrap is a PostNuke module that enables virtually any web content such as HTML or 
scripts (galleries, shopping carts, PHP, Perl, ASP, etc.) to be easily incorporated into your 
PostNuke site.  Just call the PostWrap module with any URL and it will display it in your 
PostNuke main area/window. I call it a content wrapper (takes any existing content anywhere 
and wraps your PostNuke site around it). PostWrap uses an IFRAME which must be 
supported by the browser and JavaScript to resize the IFRAME (optional).

PostWrap now comes with a block that can be added to display links for all URLs that have 
been added to PostWrap.

*	Go to Administration, Modules, and Regenerate
*	Initialize and then Activate PostWrap

Upgrading from 1.x

*	Unzip to your modules/ directory to create the PostWrap/ subdirectory
*	Go to Administration, Modules, and Regenerate
*	Initialize and then Activate PostWrap

Upgrading from 2.x

*	Go to Administration, Modules, and Regenerate

Administration
The following options can be set from the PostWrap Administration menu.

General
The General settings page defines overall settings for the PostWrap module.

*	Display off-site pages, controls whether pages not on your local domain or server can 
be displayed.
*	Allow input from browser address bar, determines whether the user can enter the 
URL in the browser address bar.
*	Compare URL against URL Security, activates URL checking from the URL Security 
page. Otherwise, any page can be displayed if it is not restricted by the other settings.
*	Add link for Open in new window, adds a link to open a new window above and 
below the page.  If one of these links is clicked, the content is opened in a new 
browser window.
*	Use fixed title, displays a fixed title above and below the page.
*	Auto-resize window, uses JavaScript to resize the content window.
*	Length of viewing window in pixels, is the length of the window that will contain the 
page.  This value will only be used if Auto resize window = No.
*	Width of viewing window in pixels or percent, is the width of the window that will 
contain the page. Default is 100%  

URL Security
If Compare URL against URL Security = Yes in the General settings, then any URL must be 
entered here in order to be displayed.

*	Add, adds a new URL and alias (either can be used to display the page)
*	Edit, edits an existing URL entry
*	Delete, deletes an existing URL entry

The following are the same as the General section but override the General setting for the 
specific URL.

*	Add link for Open in new window
*	Use fixed title
*	Auto-resize window
*	Length of viewing window in pixels
*	Width of viewing window in pixels or percent

Miscellaneous
You can modify error and user messages in the language files in your language directory (i.e. 
eng/) under modules/PostWrap/pnlang/

*	user.php, user text, messages and errors
*	admin.php, admin text and messages
*	adminapi.php, admin error and status messages
*	init.php, module initialization errors and messages

Usage
Just call PostWrap in module fashion with the page variable set to the URL or location that 
you want to display in PostNuke. If Compare URL against URL Security = Yes, then you 
may use either the URL or the alias that you defined.  The following examples assume that 
the URL and an Alias have been configured in URL Security.

HTML Anchors
You can use PostWrap URLs in HTML anchor tags to create hyperlinks in HTML 
documents or anywhere that HTML is supported.

Using a relative URL:
<a href="index.php?module=PostWrap&page=index.php">My Site</a>

Using an Alias:
<a href="index.php?module=PostWrap&page=mysite">My Site</a>

Using an absolute URL:
<a href="index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/">PostNuke Site</a>

Using an Alias:
<a href="index.php?module=PostWrap&page=postnuke">PostNuke Site</a>
	
Menu Block
You can use PostWrap URLs in a PostNuke Generic Menu block created from 
Administration, Blocks.

Using a relative URL:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=index.php

Using an Alias:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=mysite

Using an absolute URL:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/

Using an Alias:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=postnuke

URL Options
There are several variables that can be included in the URL that will override the settings in 
PostWrap Administration:

*	The height (vertical size) of the IFRAME in pixels can be set using &height=
*	The width (horizontal size) of the IFRAME in pixels or percent can be set using 
&width=
*	Auto resize of the page can be set with &resize=1 (this will override the height value 
if set)
*	The page title can be set using &title=

Examples:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/&height=1000&width=90%

index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/&resize=1

index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/&title=make it your choice

If you are using a legacy PostNuke theme, you can use the PostNuke index variable you may 
be able to show the center and right blocks by including index=1.

Example:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page=http://www.postnuke.org/&index=1

PostWrap Block
PostWrap includes a block that will automatically display a list of links for all URLs that you 
have added in the URL Security section of PostWrap administration.

*	Go to Administration, Blocks
*	Click New Block
*	Enter a Title
*	Select PostWrap/PostWrap URLs as Block
*	Select a block Position and Language
*	Click Commit changes

Differences from Older Versions
PostWrap is now pnAPI compliant and is invoked using a different URL from those of 
previous versions.  For backward compatibility, the previous method is still supported.

The old URL was of this form:
modules.php?op=modload&name=PostWrap&file=index&page=http://spidean.mckenzies.net/

The new URL is of this form:
index.php?module=PostWrap&page= http://spidean.mckenzies.net/

Known Issues
When using special characters (i.e. ? & % @ :) in the page variable in the address bar, you 
must translate the characters to their ASCII hex value preceded by a %.  The ? is %3F and & 
is %26.

Example:
page=http://somedomain.com/page.php?somevar=50&othervar=login

Becomes:
page=http://somedomain.com/page.php%3Fsomevar=50%26othervar=login
