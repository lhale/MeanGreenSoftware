		Mean Green resources has developed client-side mobile applications for some of the largest wireless carriers
		and has developed additional server-side skills for creating pervasive enterprise software.
		<p />
		A growing number of wireless carriers and service providers are creatively accommodating the increasing number of
		people surfing the web on their smart phones' browsers. There are a few <i>transcoding</i>
		solutions out there operating on a small targeted number of devices, but what if your application
		must run across a large matrix of mobile devices and competing carriers? 
		<p />
		Mean Green has the knowledge and
		expertise to help you <i>mobilize</i> an existing web application or create the
		software infrastructure necessary to support the growing plethora of micro browsers out there today.
		Your mobilized application is much more than a miniaturized version of the full desktop
		application and needs to fit your mobile user work flow and leverage the differing capabilities inherent on each device. 
		Our consultants have first hand expertise in extending and developing your enterprise software
		to match the user roles, security levels, informational needs and processes of your mobile workforce.
