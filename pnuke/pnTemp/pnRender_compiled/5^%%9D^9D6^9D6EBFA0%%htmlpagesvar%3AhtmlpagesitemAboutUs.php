    <h1 align="center">About Us</h1>
	Over the years, Mean Green consultants have become adept at adopting a Chameleon-like work mindset
	in finding the best value for our clients using the least amount of resources in a multi-disciplined
	holistic process able to analyze and implement all facets of your project.
	<p />
	We've borrowed a page or two from the Chameleon, a creature admired for its adaptability
	to changing conditions and the "mean and green" methods it uses to thrive in a wide
	variety of ecosystems. 
	Like a Chameleon, your web presence changes to reflect changes in business climate, client demographics,
    new product/service offerings and the demands of the market.
	<p />
	Mean Green Software is nimble like the Chameleon, able to adapt to a project's changing
	life cycle demands. The <i><b>mean</b></i> in Mean Green alludes to our no-nonsense methods of
	cutting through the project jungle to get the job done. The <i><b>green</b></i> in Mean Green
	symbolizes our commitment to tread softly within your business environment, 
	totally focusing on the target of achieving a cost effective, on-time, on-target
	realization of your project's philosophy and goals. 
	<p />
	Chameleons have the ability to see in different directions, achieving a 360 degree field of view.
	Mean Green's primary project methodology is to gain perspectives of the project from multiple angles -
	the business domain, business and process analysis, planning and scoping, information architecture, 
	iterative software analysis and design, development, testing, documentation and deployment.
	Mean Green has these diverse discipline resources at hand to lend differing perspectives to your project,
	resulting in a unified, no-surprises solution that merges seamlessly into the domain environment, just like the Chameleon. 
	In other words, we're able to deftly handle your project from start to finish in a holistic fashion.
    <!-- Mean Green has a slightly different perspective on doing business with our valued clients. -->

	<p />
	<!-- List out the mgmt strengths, various meth's -->
	The net result of completing many projects for many clients is that each has its own working culture
	and project management methodology. Mean Green project managers and our seasoned developers are able
	to work very effectively under these project management environments:

        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Rational Unified Process</a></u></li>
		<br />
		RUP is used to structure a project in flexible, iterative and interwoven steps that conforms to
		our client's processes. Powerful and productive RUP tools can be used that helps define and
		track the full project range, from business process modeling and requirements gathering to testing and deploy management.
		For projects requiring formalized compliance based processes, this is our first choice.
		<p /p>
        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEE_model" class="meangreen" target="_blank">V Model</a></u></li>
		<br />
		V Model is a process stressing verification and validation of complex software systems that are required
		to go through the rigors of a formalized SDLC process, as is found in the life sciences and space technology arenas.
		This is our second choice for projects spanning moderate complexity and collaboration amongst
		diverse product/services groups within your company. 
		<p /p>
        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_development" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Agile development</a></u></li>
		<br />
		Your customer's current needs and goals are the primary focus when using Agile methods in a frequently iterative
		and lightweight planning process. The progress of your project is readily viewed in short, incrementing
		steps throughout. Mean Green recommends this process with a small and nimble development team focused on
		delivering specific functionality within a short time frame.
		<p /p>
        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development" class="meangreen" target="_blank">RAD</a></u></li>
		<br />
		The Rapid Application Development model is not for the squeamish. It is based on committments from
		the project owners to modularize and reuse prototype components discovered during the business, data, process modeling phases
		and generate the application in an abbreviated time period. 
		This method works well when the requirements are well known and understood. Mean Green recommends this process
		if the culture fit is there and Web 2.0 style collaborative developement is in play. 
		<p /p>
        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Extreme Programming</a></u></li>
		<br />
		For projects with many unknown variables and requirements, this methodology that stresses short term feedback
		loops, brief stand up meetings, minimum documentation, test-first development and a typical pairing of developers
		focused on as-soon-as-possible release of tested functionality. Mean Green recommends this process methodology only under
		the rare conditions of augmenting a development team consisting of senior individuals that have demonstrably worked 
		exceptionally well together.
		<p /p>
        <li type=square compact><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#Modified_models" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Modifed Waterfall</a></u></li>
		<br />
		For those organizations that have a formal requirements to maintenance cascading process,
		the modified waterfall model is used and recommended. Requirements do not have to be "set in stone" and all
		analysis and design complete before development commences.

    	We have the ability, experience and expertise to conform to your business processes and needs to get the

	<li><h3 id="ProjectHolistics2">Project Holistics</h3>
    	<p />
    	Our view of holistic project management is actually a simple basic one that is
    	sometimes complicated to implement. Project holisitics is a way to manage
    	<b>ALL</b> of the many parts of a project, its environment, the customer/user environment
    	and take your project in the 
    	direction that you envision it should go. Project stakeholders may be versed
    	in a specific aspect of a project - management, development, testing and so on.
    	Mean Green has a small cadre of multi disciplined professionals that
    	have expertise from top level management to working the nuts and bolts of a project.
    	In other words, we have a few guru level jack-of-all-trades people at your service.

		of your cutomers while supplying them with a "cradle to cradle" solution. Mean
		Green looks at your project as a continuum of your business adaptions that
