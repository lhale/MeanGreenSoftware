<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The site editor takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants
you to feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals
with personally-identifiable information (referred to as
&quot;data&quot; below) that may be collected by this site. This policy
does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the
site editor, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or
agents of the site editor, or that are not under the site editor's
control. Please take time to read this site's <a href="<?php echo smarty_function_pnmodurl(array('modname' => 'legal'), $this);?>
">Terms
of use</a>.</p>
<h2>1. Collection of data</h2>
<p>Registration for an account on this site requires only a valid
e-mail address and a user name that has not been chosen already. You are
not required to provide any other information if you do not want to.
Please be aware that the user name you choose, the e-mail address you
provide and any other information you enter may render you personally
identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site
intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration
process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or
unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third
party). As on many web sites, the site editor may also automatically
receive general information that is contained in server log files, such
as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how
advertising may be served on this site (if it is indeed the site
editor's policy to display advertising) is set forth below.</p>
<h2>2. Use of data</h2>
<p>Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on
this site. Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made
available to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this
Privacy Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose
to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided
on our site requires interaction with a third party, or is provided by a
third party, such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to
legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this
site violates the site editor's policy, terms of service, or other usage
guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by the site editor
to protect the site editor's legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this
site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will
be able to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this policy.
In the event you choose to use links displayed on this web site to visit
other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies published
