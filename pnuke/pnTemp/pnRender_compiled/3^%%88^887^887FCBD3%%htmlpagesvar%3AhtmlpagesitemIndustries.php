        <li type=square compact><u>Real Time Biomonitoring</u></li>   <!-- Therapeutic drug monitoring -->
		<br />
		Around the world, clinical regulatory agencies and biomonitoring companies 
		 are focusing on improving the ability to monitor medical subjects under therapy in real time. 
		This is
		especially important in the clinical trial arena, where thousands of trials worldwide are conducted
		with a scarcity of reliable, timely and frequent or regular patient data observations. Additional patient care and
		monitoring areas within the typical laboratory, clinical and home venues are increasingly demanding more observational
		oversight with the goal in concurrently improving the consistency of measurement, level of care, comfort and lowered mortality rates.
		<p /> 
		Mean Green Software has been at the forefront in helping realize this vision.

        <li type=square compact><u>Clinical Trial Management System</u></li>
		<br />
		Discovery and delivering a new drug to market typically costs hundreds of millions of dollars and several years
		of rigorous effort. 
		Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies continually rely on improvements in software technologies and information systems
		to add efficiency to this process. Regulatory agencies across the globe are stepping up the need for more
		disclosure, process oversight and "personalized therapy" or individualized medicine regimens. 
		<p />
		Clinical trial management systems are harnessed to manage this complex process involving 
		laboratory, government, clinical and contract research organizations and information systems.
		Mean Green has accomplished using open source technologies to aid in trial patient and group (or cohort) screening,
		observational record management and trends analysis.

        <li type=square compact><u>PD/PK Bioinformatics</u></li>
		<br />
		Biomonitoring information gathered and statistically correlated are subsequently used to study what a drug does to the body
		(Pharmacodynamics, or PD) and conversely study what the body does to a drug (Pharmacokinetics, or PK).
		Rigorous discovery of complex data mining and correlations in the bio data of individual medical subjects or groups
		leads to previously unknown discoveries in areas of AMDE/Tox, pathway relationship refinements in adaptive dosing 
		and a host of other expected and unexpected revelations.
		<p />
		In areas of observational archiving, trends analysis, alerting and reporting, 
		Mean Green consultants have ushered new and maverick methods for implementing these activities in the trialing process. 
		  <!-- FDA adaptive dosing, ADME/Tox, Statistical Analyses -->
		<!-- Pharmacokinetics is the study of what the body does to a drug. Pharmacodynamics is the study of what a drug does to the body. -->
		<!-- Pharmacodynamics is a description of the many different ways that drugs affect the body. -->

	An outgrowth of Life Sciences is the critical and crucial steps of securely analyzing, archiving and sharing

	<p />
	Our consultants leverage open source and third party software to manage the selection and anonymizing
	of patients in the clinical arena. Access to patient information by medical personnel is strictly limited

        <li type=square compact><u>Portable Micro Assay</u></li>
		<br />
		Formal laboratory assay equipment has been routinely miniaturized down to the size of a toaster
		by many companies around the globe.
		This allows complex biochemistry based microassays involving up to a few dozen protein biomarkers
		to be conducted outside of the standard lab environment. Assay development speed, frequency and
		consistency are managed by on site devices uploading assay results to hosted server bioinformation based
		applications.

        <li type=square compact><u>Medical ultrasound diagnostics</u></li>
		<br />
		Usage and application of mature ultrasound imaging technologies have blossomed in areas
		unimaginable in the last decade. Patented imaging and signal processing technologies
		constantly push the envelope on what can be done and what can be seen. A typical standard practice is
		DICOM based
		image archival and retrieval systems integrating into the hospital enterprise environment.
		The ultrasound platform can suffice as an intra or extranet based web appliance to facilitate
		remote telemedicine requirements.
		<p /> 
		Mean Green has in house expertise in many of these areas available to help your organization
		realize the full potential of your diagnostic products. We have experience in the medical
		device regulatory environment.
		<p />
		
		<li type=square compact><u>Diagnosing the medical diagnostic equipment</u></li>
		<br />
		Contemporary diagnostic equipment rivals the complexity of a cloud computing environment
		wedded to intricate video processing equipment. The archival systems are similar to that
		of a networked secure redundant data back end. Keeping all of this diagnostic equipment operating
		per specification and within regulatory tolerances is the job of on board diagnostics
		capable of fault triangulation and initiating field service alerts.
		<p />
		Mean Green can help you formulate and implement your system diagnostic strategy.
