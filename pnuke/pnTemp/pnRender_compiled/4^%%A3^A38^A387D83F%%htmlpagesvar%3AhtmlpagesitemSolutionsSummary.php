	<li><h3 id="EnterpriseIntegration2">Enterprise Integration</h3>
	Mean Green has knowledge and expertise gained in integrating several common enterprise software
	systems inside the firewalls of many clients. 
	Here's an overview of some of our enterprise integration solutions:
	<p /> 
	  <menu>
        <li type=square compact><u>Salesforce.com Integration</u></li>
		<br />
		A compiler product client required a custom built web application used to attract academic 
		and commercial trial users and
		track prospective marketing partners
		tied in to Salesforce.com's SOA interface for contact and tracking purposes.
		A LAMP based approach was used to extend the client's
		existing web application written mainly in PHP with a limited MySQL backend running on Linux.
		Our solution enabled the client to increase site traffic for their products and allow
		the 'hook' for marketing partners.
		
		<p></p> 
        <li type=square compact><u>Online Shopping and Forum</u></li>
		<br />
		A young woman's clothing boutique needed to build out their website catalog capability to
		quick-turn mimic their frequent paper catalog distributions. As fashion seasons change quickly, the need for
		a content management system managed and administered by the client was put in place using 
		<a href="http://edocs.bea.com/wlcs/docs20/comp/overview.htm#1035376" class="meangreen" target="_blank">WebLogic's Ecommerce platform.</a>
		An on line forum was built to entice their shoppers
		to linger longer. The result was a system that could be easily maintained by the client's
		small IT group that harmonized with the graphic arts group producing the paper catalog.
		
		<p></p> 
        <li type=square compact><u>Online bidding for art's sake</u></li>
		<br />
		A company focusing on wholesale bidding for works of art needed to bring their auction capabilities
		to the web. Websphere Commerce Suite was used to build the auction system and facilitate
		art item entry for the client.
		
		<p></p>
		<a name="ManufacturingIntegration" href="#"> </a>
        <li type=square compact><u>Manufacturing Enterprise Systems</u></li>
		<br />
		A client utilizing Rockwell's 
		<a href="http://www.rockwellautomation.com/industries/lifesciences/mes.html" class="meangreen" target="_blank">MES automation system</a> 
		required critical server uploading of batch item
		information for micro assay cartridges. Cases of cartridges destined for quality assurance sampling and
		field sales personnel required locational tracking by the web server platform used to correlate the use of 
		an assay cartridge by a specific extranet user or patient. Additionally, a intranet method for data entry of
		batch lots and cartridge types was tailored for manufacturing and biochemical QA personnel.
		<p />
		Direct engagement of client and Rockwell personnel led to the formulation of a cartridge information
		and tracking support system using open source components such as <a href="http://jboss.com/products/index" class="meangreen" target="_blank">JBoss</a> application server, 
		MySQL DBMS and a J2EE framework consisting of JSF, EJB3 and hibernate. Due to regulatory compliance
		requirements, role based access control (RBAC) was implemented using additional open source components
		and CAPA procedures were followed and implemented into the server application solution infrastructure.
		<p />
	    <!-- Explanation of CAPA (fr http://www.complianceonline.com/ecommerce/control/trainingFocus/~product_id=700141):
		   (Could not find a good what-is hlink, closest is http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/present/advamed-052505-marcarelli.PPT)
		   The Quality Systems Regulation (21 CFR 820) and the Quality Management Standard for Medical Devices (ISO 13485:2003), require medical device companies to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action (CAPA) as an integral part of the quality system. The CAPA system to identify problems may be initiated by any non-conforming event, trend, or finding, internal or external, relating to: materials, systems, components, finished devices, software, labeling, packaging, documentation, processes, tests, inspections, training, equipment, environment, maintenance, calibration, suppliers, distribution, design control or management review. A functional CAPA system is supported by robust root cause analysis.
		-->
		
		<p></p>
        <li type=square compact><u>Custom Integrations</u></li>
		<br />
		A number of Mean Green clients have technical staff on-board that had created custom proprietary
		system software that requires either further integration, enhancement or third party replacement.
		Our expertise in a handful of scripting languages and enterprise languages and infrastructures
		(like Java and J2EE, respectively) allow Mean Green to "hit the ground running" on your custom
		integration work. Mean Green has the collaboration and augmentation skills to work seamlessly with
		your technical teams.

	<a name="Mobile" href="#"> </a>
	<li><h3 id="Mobile2">Mobile</h3>
	Most of Mean Green's mobile expertise lies in server side support of mobile devices and mobilizing new
	and legacy applications, but we have experience delving into client side development
	for a plethora of pervasive devices. Here are a few of our accomplishments:
		<p></p>
	<p />
	  <menu>
	  
        <li type=square compact><u>Mobile Physician Portal</u></li>
		<br />
		A client who successfully deployed a large desktop browser portal application geared for physicians
		wanted to support specific facets of the application on a matrix of devices spanning several carriers,
		micro browsers and mobile product lines. Every device had its own limitations in capabilities and 
		operational eccentricities, challenged further by carrier and browser restrictions. The client
		required most of the richness of the desktop portal operable on all units in the matrix.
		<p></p>
		Our talented professionals at Mean Green met and succeeded this challenge by extending the 
		presentation layer of the legacy Vignette portal using a strategy design pattern 
		and creating new JSP pages and basic DHTML able to run on all device browsers
		at a Mobile XHTML 1.0 level.
		Testing was facilitated by devices in-hand, at the client's site and via DeviceAnywhere services.
		Formal Agile-style project management was conducted by both parties.
		
		<p></p>
        <li type=square compact><u>Location Based Services (LBS)</u></li>
		<br />
		Requirements for two LBS products, one that tracked people and inventory via RFID, and the second
		utilizing GPS phones and trackers to monitor and report the whereabouts of family, friends, 
		assets of interest and appointments. Both solutions utilized client-patented LBS core Java technology 
		running on <a href="http://jboss.com/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">JBoss</a> 
		clustered application server infrastructure integrated into SMS and other wireless gateways.
		<p></p>
		
	    <menu>
        <li type=circle></li>
		A J2EE RFID server application listens for RFID tag events from deployed RFID readers and
		managed the affinity of tag to person or thing. A reporting structure controlled by application
		administrators messaged recipients based upon selectable geolocational criteria. For instance,
		a parent could be notified via SMS when their children got to school or an attendee could be
		position-tracked and mapped in a convention venue. Other RFID applications, such as tracking
		factory floor goods, could easily be accommodated and displayed on the user's browser.
		<p></p>
        <li type=circle></li>
		A J2EE GPS server application listens for configurable geolocation and temporal events 
		from a series of varying GPS phone and specialized trackers to record, monitor and configure
		any type of event through the administrator browser interface. Each wireless carrier
		had their own branded browser interface and requirements for subscriber services. 
		Geofencing capabilities allowed users to be alerted on proximity to a geofence or
		notified about upcoming appointments and a map to their appointed destination.
		Every user was filtered through strict access control structures
		and was able to set up reporting alerts based on their level of subscription.
		<p></p>
	    </menu>
		
		Formal project management for both projects was conducted solely by Mean Green resources as a method to track over
		two dozen remote contract workers focusing on development and QA testing.
		<p></p>
		
        <li type=square compact><u>Visitor Based Networking (VBN) Personalization</u></li>
		<br />
		Using synchronous WiFi, a J2EE application using <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat</a> 
		and <a href="http://www.opencms.org/opencms/en/index.html" class="meangreen" target="_blank">OpenCMS</a> tracked venue visitors and served up
		personalized content depending upon their level of knowledge and interest. On site personnel were able
		to manage the multimedia content streamed to rented visitor headsets and PDAs.
	  	<p></p>
		
        <li type=square compact><u>Store Sales Assistant Wizard</u></li>
		<br />
		An electronic goods client requiring an in-store wireless sales assistant to aid salespeople
		utilized iPAQ PDAs and the CommerceOne eCommerce platform with 
		<a href="http://www.interwoven.com/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Interwoven's content management system</a>
		to create a mobile store catalog, replete with sale item enticements. Product comparison
		information was maintained and managed by regional store managers.
	  	<p></p>
		
        <li type=square compact><u>'Winemart' Inventory Control and Information</u></li>
		<br />
		A proof of concept application using
		<a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/weblogic/platform/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Weblogic</a>  
		and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/business/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=8b75322c369b5110VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Symbol wireless scanning devices</a>
		was created to
		demonstrate the ability of the system to track wine product from the receiving dock to the
		store floor. Bar scanning of incoming wine bottle pallets were tracked through the final retail sale
		on the store floor. Consumer information about each wine was made available by the customer scanning
		the bottle with a Palm OS based Symbol scanner and reading reviews and other information about the product.

        <li type=square compact><u>Clinical Trials</u></li>
		<br />
           A client required basic Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) for purposes's of electronic data capture
           (EDC) and Clinical Data Management (CDM) for Phase II-IV trials. 
           <a href="http://www.inforsense.com/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Inforsense </a>
           was used to understand and implement
           the trial protocol diversities and complex specialized work flow behavior unique to each clinical trial.
           The ability to deftly organize the interaction of research groups and business units within the pharma/regulatory
           environment leads to reduced management costs, streamlined processes and reporting efficiencies throughout the trial.
           <p />
           Trial study candidate selection and investigator patient cohort grouping activities were managed by 
		   <a href="http://www.openclinica.org/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">OpenClinica</a>,
           an open source solution used by many research organizations. OpenClinica is also used to configure the study's
           case report forms (CRFs) and for capturing or retrieving the observational data in HL7 RIM format.

        	A number of Mean Green clients requiring health care record solutions were satisfied with a handful of
        	J2EE based solutions leveraging some fairly large open source technology infrastructures. 
        	Whatever a patient's health record might be called, the end result should be an accurate, comprehensive,
        	and secure manifest of all health care information pertinent to maintaining the wellness of the patient.
        	Medical observations, diagnoses, surveys, demographics, insurance and other critical information requires
        	a handful of technical solutions inter playing together.

        	<p /p>
        	One of our clients required a method and process to archive and conditionally retrieve generic observations. 
        	The tactic was to allow the client the ability to easily define a new observation method or data format.
        	The implementation strategy was <a href="http://www.openemed.net/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">OpenEMed's</a>

    	<br />
		Mean Green has two stories of interest here:
		<p />
		
		<menu>
        <li type=circle></li>
        The first story is a requirement a few years back to real-time monitor and report on 
        environmental conditions on a campuses of buildings  based in
        China, Bahrain and North America. This was to be employed by utilizing micromote
        sensors that monitored temperature, humidity and barometric pressure within each structure.
        Monitoring and reporting of outdoor temperature, wind speed, direction and light level readings
        occurred at specified places around the campus. Strategically located embedded Linux data collectors
        forwarded the mesh connected micromote data on to a LAMP based reporting server accessible only to
        those with the approved need. A report generator could subsequently process the amassed 
        environmental information in a number of configurable ways.
  	  	<p />
  	   The solution applications for this sensing and reporting technology are boundless. For
  	   example, specific gases or radiological elements could readily be real-time monitored for
  	   a Homeland Security type of project. Motion sensors could be used to shutdown in an orderly fashion
  	   critical building systems during an earthquake and check the environment for safety afterwards.

      	Our second story is a recent requirement to real-time monitor, analyze and report the conditions
      	of a group of selected patients (or cohorts) and message care recipients about possible adverse reactions to
      	drug therapy regimens. The converse requirement is alerting medical personnel when a 
      	patient-personalized therapy fell below some predefined efficacy threshold. Regression based
      	statistical analysis allowed the application to portend trends and correlating
      	results at a per patient level and quickly warn the appropriate medical investigative personnel.
  		<p />
      	A J2EE based clustered application running client-patented computational analytics was employed
      	to receive the assay results from remote embedded measuring devices and relay user-configurable
      	events and information to targeted recipients via SMS, pagers, or other notification methods.
		Regulatory compliance required accommodation for CAPA and QA testing based on the IQ/OQ/PQ test protocol V-model.

		running on Java and LAMP based server architectures.
		<p />
		In the bioinformatics realm, the use of data mining techniques coupled with single and
		multiple regression based statistical analysis algorithms are used to aid researchers
		in understanding and discovering relationships between multivariate entities. Use of
		computational biology algorithms for multidimensional predictive analysis allowed
		software to alert investigators about unseen trends or relationships in biomarker's
		effects upon seemingly unrelated systems of the body.
		<p />
		In the registered user realm, applications of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olap" class="meangreen" target="_blank">OLAP</a>
		and other analytical processing solutions are used
		in many ways to personalize and enhance the user experience while providing IT service
		organizations with the tracking and reporting tools needed to improve and add service offerings,
		track strategic partner transactions, budgeting/forecasting and a host of other types of business
		intelligence. Mean Green is elemental at harnessing open source and third party software
		(such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognos" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Cognos</a> 
		and <a href="http://www.inforsense.com/" class="meangreen" target="_blank">Inforsense </a>)
		to fulfill our client's OLAP and hyper cube processing requirements.
